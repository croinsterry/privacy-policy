Last Updated: June 10, 2025

HairCutEase ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you use our mobile application ("App") or related services. By using HairCutEase, you consent to the practices described in this policy.

1. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our services:

- Personal Information: Information you voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, phone number, and payment details, when you register, book appointments, or make payments through the App.
- Queue and Booking Data: Details related to your appointment bookings, live queue participation, and preferences to manage your salon visits.
- Usage Data: Information about how you interact with the App, including features used, time spent, navigation patterns, and the Android Advertising ID (with your consent) for analytics purposes to understand user behavior and improve our services.
- Device Information: Technical data such as device type, operating system, IP address, and unique device identifiers to optimize App performance and ensure security.
- Location Data: With your explicit consent, we may collect approximate or precise location information to provide real-time updates on queue status or recommend nearby salons.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use your information for the following purposes:

- Functionality: Facilitate appointment bookings, manage virtual queues, and process payments securely through third-party payment processors.
- Communication: Send real-time updates and notifications about your bookings, queue status, or responses to your inquiries.
- Personalization: Suggest salons or services based on your preferences and usage patterns, including personalized ads (with your consent, using the Android Advertising ID).
- Analytics: Improve the App’s functionality and user experience through analytics tools like Firebase Analytics, which may use the Android Advertising ID to analyze engagement and optimize our services.
- Marketing: Send promotional offers or newsletters, where you have opted in to receive them.
- Security: Ensure the integrity and security of our services, including fraud prevention.

3. Advertising ID and User Consent
We use the Android Advertising ID, with your consent, to provide personalized ads and analyze user engagement through Firebase Analytics. You can opt out of personalized ads at any time via your device settings (e.g., Android’s “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting) or by adjusting preferences within the App. If you opt out, we will not use the Advertising ID for personalized ads, but we may still collect anonymized data for analytics purposes.

4. Sharing Your Information
We may share your information as follows:

- Salon Partners: Necessary details (e.g., name, appointment time) are shared with salons or barbershops to coordinate bookings and queue management.
- Third-Party Service Providers: We use trusted providers, such as Google Firebase Analytics (see Google’s Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy) for analytics and payment processors for secure transactions. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and only process it for specified purposes.
- Legal Compliance: We may disclose information when required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of HairCutEase, our users, or the public.

We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

5. Data Protection
We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures, such as encryption and secure servers, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. Payment transactions are processed using secure encryption. However, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. Your Choices and Rights
You have the following choices and rights, depending on your jurisdiction:

- Opt-Out of Personalized Ads: Disable personalized ads via your device settings or App preferences, which will limit the use of the Android Advertising ID.
- Opt-Out of Marketing: Unsubscribe from promotional emails or notifications through the App or by contacting us.
- Access and Correction: Request access to or correction of your personal information.
- Deletion: Request deletion of your data, subject to legal retention requirements.
- Data Portability: Request a copy of your data in a structured, portable format.

To exercise these rights, contact us at haircutease@gmail.com. We will respond within the timeframes required by applicable law (e.g., 30 days for GDPR requests).

7. Data Retention
We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide our services, fulfill legal obligations, or resolve disputes. For example, booking and payment data may be retained for up to 7 years for accounting or compliance purposes. Usage data, including Advertising IDs, is retained in anonymized form for analytics unless you request deletion.

8. Third-Party Services
The App integrates with third-party services, such as Firebase Analytics (operated by Google) and payment gateways. These services have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review (e.g., Google’s Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy). HairCutEase is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services.

9. International Data Transfers
Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your jurisdiction, including the United States, where our servers or third-party providers (e.g., Google Firebase) are located. We ensure appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, are in place to protect your data.

10. Children’s Privacy
HairCutEase is not intended for users under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn such data has been collected, we will delete it promptly.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes via the App, email, or a prominent notice on our website. The updated policy will be effective upon posting.
